    Because the repo did not contain a git mailmap, one has been generated by node-idman to avoid expertise of real persons being assigned to multiple aliases. The table belows shows which Commit Names/Email have been mapped to which Proper Names/Emails. The name/email-pair with the most commits was used as Proper Name/Email. All names/emails not listed have been left untouched.
